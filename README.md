# deREferencing

deReferencing is an IDA Pro plugin that implements new registers and stack views. Adds dereferenced pointers, colors and other useful information, similar to some GDB plugins (e.g: PEDA, GEF, pwndbg, etc).

Supports following architectures: x86, x86-64, ARM, ARM64, MIPS32 and MIPS64

This is fork of original deREferencing repo (https://github.com/danigargu/deREferencing) working under IDA-Pro >= 9.x version
